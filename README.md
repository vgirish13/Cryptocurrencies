# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

### Accountability Accounting has tasked Martha and I with breaking down its potential cryptocurrency portfolio. In this module, I preprocessed data for principal component analysis and reduced data dimensions for PCA. Then, I clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-means. Finally, I provided visualizations of our results for Martha to share with the board.
